# Tipple Invoice

<!-- BADGES/ -->

<!-- /BADGES -->

Tipple Full Stack Developer Task

Tipple processes multiple invoices per day manually from different suppliers, one of our main suppliers has the option to supply us with a digital copy of the invoice, the invoice is a DBF file and is formatted in a certain way.

We would like an easier way to process these invoices utilising the DBF files supplied by our supplier, store and retrieve. 

For this task we would like to see your skills in both backend and front end, including using a database of choice.

I have attached a DBF file and the matching PDF to one of the invoices we receive from our suppliers.

Get creative and let the development begin. 

## Before you start
Please notice this project not complete yet. It was built with Yii 2 Starter Kit
http://yii2-starter-kit.terentev.net/
So, this framework also include CMS, RABC, Log ,etc  but this is not the point.

I add the part of products mangement, invoice management,

###NOTE
This template was created mostly for developers NOT for end users.
This is a point where you can begin your application, rather than creating it from scratch.
Good luck!

####Tasks


TODO:
1. upload a csv file
2. more stable
3. adding some frontend effect 

##### Frontend part
Due to the time limitation, now is all developed based on Bootstrap3 version of Admintle.
Which can be changed into angular version in the future.

##### Backend part
Consider the development efficient, I choos Yii Framework, This framework is a good balance for
best practice design to performance.

##### Database
I also setup the datebase with mysql 5.7 ,with master slave structure and json formate date suppport.

I also use migration for sql management.
#####Server part
I choose Alicloud which is more cheaper than AWS and also provide storng performance 
as well as stability.
The session is setup with redis which is
more convenient for us to build up distributed system with load balance in the future.

Linux + nginx + Mysql + PHP7
